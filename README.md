# WARNING:
This has a lot of Potato Code held by a razor-wire shoestring - Touch it, and it might snap and crumble

A few notes:
1. A lot of paddings and margins used incorrectly all across the project
2. Contact Section is not shrinking as with the other sections. I only left the code for a day, so I'm confused as to why I couldn't replicate the same behavior. Leaving it as a PEBCAC that hasn't RTFM properly
